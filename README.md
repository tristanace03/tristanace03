# About Me:
I am a Computer Science senior at Illinois State University graduating in the Spring 2026 semester. <br>Most of my work focuses on machine learning, computer vision and artificial intelligence. <br><br>My current work spans across ag-tech, embedded ML and applied AI research. Professionally, <br>I work as an IT Innovation Intern at GROWMARK, Inc., where I developed a computer vision model <br>for estimating corn yield estimations from a photo of an ear of corn. Academically, I have conducting research<br>involving lower power cryptography for CubeSats and automatic sign language translation. <br><br>I am building toward a career as a machine learning engineer or applied AI engineer, <br>working on systems that operate in the real world, whether that be in meteorology, agriculture, <br>or another cause meaningful to me.
